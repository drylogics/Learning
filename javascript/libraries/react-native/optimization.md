# Optimization

> “The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times; **premature optimization is the root of all evil** (or at least most of it) in programming.”     - Donald Knuth (The Art of Computer Programming)

## Images
- use [react-native-fast-image](https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image) or implement similar behaviour  
- dynamically modify pictures the dimensions you need instead of using resizeMode. One solution is [cloudimage](https://www.cloudimage.io/)
